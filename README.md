<!-- Plugin description -->
This plugin aims to simplify your everyday life if you are often changing screen (from big to small, and reverse), and struggling with your font size.

On big screens, you may want big font size, and on common screens, it can be smaller. 

This plugin allows you to think your IDE as a web browser (media queries): set breakpoints (e.g. 0px, 1200px, 1980px), and set suitable font size for these dimensions.

Font size will change automatically, depending on your IDE width.
